	 * are correlated to another stream of tuples, the plan is opened and closed for
	 * every such. The OPEN call gets as parameter the tuple for which the correlated

	 * // S is the outer child of the Nested-Loop-Join.
	 * // R is the inner child of the Nested-Loop-Join.

	 *       r := R.next();

	 *   
	 *   return concatenation of r and s;
	 * }
	 * 
	 * @param epoch	The epoch the tuples to be returned have to belong to.
	 * @param correlatedTuple The tuple for which the correlated tuples in the sub-plan
	 *                        below and including this operator are to be fetched. Is
	 *                        null is the case that the plan produces no correlated tuples.

	 *                                 that means that the necessary actions failed.

/**
 * This interface defines methods to access data from a binary table page. The
 * table page consists of three sections: header, record sequence and variable-length-chunk.
 * <p>
 * The header is fixed to 32 bytes, the record sequence and the variable-length-chunk grow
 * depending on the number and length of variable-length fields in the inserted tuples.
 * <p>
 * <b>Definition of terms:</b> A tuple refers to the logical construct of a tuple, that is
 * inserted into the page or retrieved from the page. Record refers to the physical representation
 * in binary form in a page.
 * <p>
 * All methods return the tuples with their fields in the order as on the page.
 * <p>
 * Several methods contain a bitmap to describe which columns are supposed to be fetched and which
 * ones are not fetched. In such a bitmap, a <i>1</i> at position <i>n</i> (counting from the least
 * significant bit) means that the <i>n</i>'th column should be fetched. In that sense, a tuple is
 * for example constructed via a loop as in the following example:
 * 
 * <code>
 * long bitmap = ...;
 * int numCols = ...;
 * 
 * Tuple t = new Tuple(numCols);
 * 
 * for (int i = 0; i < numCols & bitmap != 0; bitmap >>>= 1) {
 *   if (bitmap & 0x1 == 0) {
 *     continue;
 *   }
 *   
 *   t.assignColumn(i, "get-i'th-field-of-the-tuple");
 *   i++;
 * }
 * </code>

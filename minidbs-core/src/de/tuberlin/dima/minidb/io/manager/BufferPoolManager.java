/**
 * Class used to provide uniform and thread safe access to pages. Pages are either fetched from the cache, 
 * or, if not found in the cache, loaded from secondary storage. All methods in this class must be designed
 * for concurrent access by multiple threads. Any modification to shared structures must be synchronized or
 * realized through other atomic operations to prevent inconsistencies.
 * <p> 
 * 
 * <p>
 * General mechanism of synchronization:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>All accesses to one of the caches are synchronized on that specific cache object.</li>
 *   <li>All accesses to the load and write queue are synchronized through a central lock or monitor. 
 *   <li>When adding an item that was not found in the cache to the queues, the cache lock
 *       must not be released in the meantime to make sure that a cache miss and the addition
 *       to the queues remains atomic.</li>
 *   <li>When removing pages from the queues and adding them to the cache, the operation must
 *       hold both the cache and the monitor lock before starting to remove the pages.</li>
 * </ul>

	 * This method adds a page to the cache by adding a cache entry for it. The entry must not be

	 * If the cache is still pretty cold (new) that the evicted entry may be an
	 * entry containing no resource data. In any way does the evicted entry contain a binary page

	 * For ARC, if the page was not in any of the bottom lists (B lists), the page enters the MRU end of the
	 * T1 list. The newly added page is not considered as hit yet. Therefore the first getPage() request to that
	 * page produces the first hit and does not move the page out of the T1 list. This functionality is important
	 * to allow pre-fetched pages to be added to the cache without causing the first actual "GET" request to
	 * mark them as frequent.
	 * If the page was contained in any of the Bottom lists before, it will directly enter the T2 list (frequent
	 * items). Since it is directly considered frequent, it is considered to be hit.

	 * @throws CachePinnedException Thrown, if no page could be evicted, because all pages
	 *                              are pinned.
	 * @throws DuplicateCacheEntryException Thrown, if an entry for that page is already contained.
	 *                                      The entry is considered to be already contained, if an
